## Usage

### Downloading notes and comments on Syncsketch.com

In this addon, "notes" are the raw sketches draw on your syncsketch reviews, "comments" are the text comments written on the side.

On Syncsketch, you can download the "Maya Grease Pencile File" as your notes, and the "Item notes as CSV" as your comments:

You will end up with a `shot_name.greasepencil.zip` and a `.CSV` file.
